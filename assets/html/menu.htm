            <h3>How to Play</h3>
            <h4>Start the Game</h4>
            <p>
                Hit <b>Play</b> button to navigate to the game page.
            </p>
            <h4>The Goal</h4>
            <p>
                A permutation of four out of six colors is generated randomly and you have to discover it.
            </p>
            <h4>Choosing colors</h4>
            <p>
                There are six buttons for six colors and four buttons for four spots.
                <br>
                You can activate any spot by taping it.
                <br>
                You can fill the active spot by taping any one of the six color buttons.
                <br>
                You can change the color of a spot by activating it and tapping the desired color button.
                <br>
                To clear the color of a spot, tap it again after activating it.
            </p>
            <h4>Go Button</h4>
            <p>
                After selecting four distinct colors, press <b>Go</b> button to see the scores.
                <br>
                A new row with your selected colors will be created and the scores will be shown at the right side of it.
                <br>
                Each row will go on top of the previous ones.
            </p>
            <h4>Scores</h4>
            <p>
                For any selected color that is part of the answer, you will get a score, black or gray.
                <br>
                <b>Black Score:</b> the position of the selected color is correct.
                <br>
                <b>Gray Score:</b> the position of the selected color is not correct.
                <br>
                The scores are not at the same order of the selected colors. Black scores come first, followed by gray ones.
                <br>
                The scores of your selections will guide you to find the answer. 
            </p>
            <h4>End of Game</h4>
            <p>
                Game will end when you guess the answer and get four black scores.
                <br>
                You can end game with <b>Give Up</b> button and the answer will be applied to the spot buttons.
                <br>
                You can start a new game any time with <b>New</b> button.
                <br>
                Come back here by pressing <b>Pause</b> button.
            </p>
