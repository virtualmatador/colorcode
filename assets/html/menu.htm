            <h4>Go Button</h4>
            <p>

            </p>
            <h4>Scores</h4>
            <p>
                For any color thet has been selected correctly, you will get a black or gray score.
                <br>
                A gray score means the position of the color in your selection doesn't match the position of the color in the hidden combination.
                <br>
                A black score means the position of the color is correct too.
                <br>
                Use the scores of your previous selections, if any, to find the hidden combination. 
            </p>
            <h4>End of Game</h4>
            <p>
